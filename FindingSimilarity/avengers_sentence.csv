"""Look out for the little guy. Make mistakes. Take chances. Because if there’s one thing life’s taught me, there’s always room to grow.""
―Scott Lang

Scott Edward Harris Lang is a former convicted thief who was struggling to pay child support to his estranged wife for visitation rights to his daughter, Cassie Lang. With the promise of money, he was convinced by Hank Pym to take on the mantle of Ant-Man, a superhero with an advanced suit designed to shrink its wearer to a tiny size while increasing one's toughness, agility, and physical strength. Trained under Pym and his daughter Hope van Dyne, Ant-Man was to help foil Pym's former protege Darren Cross, who was intending to sell his Yellowjacket Suit design and his copy of the Pym Particles formula to HYDRA and the Ten Rings. However, their plan was discovered by Cross, culminating in a final fight between Yellowjacket and Ant-Man. To defeat him, Ant-Man shrunk small enough to enter Yellowjacket's suit and destroy it, sending Ant-Man to the Quantum Realm, but he was able to escape. Ant-Man's heroism helped restore his relationship with Cassie and his ex-wife, as well as find a new romantic one with van Dyne. Lang soon learned that the Avengers were seeking for his help.
Against Pym and van Dyne's wishes, Ant-Man joined Captain America's side during the Avengers Civil War, having been recommended by the Falcon following their previous encounter. Ant-Man fought against Iron Man and his allies, allowing Captain America and Winter Soldier to escape. Ant-Man and several of his new allies were then arrested and imprisoned in the Raft by Thaddeus Ross. When Captain America arrived to free them, Ant-Man escaped, but later made a deal with the FBI to be put under house arrest so that he could still spend time with his family.
Three days before Lang could finish his sentence, he had a strange vision of Janet van Dyne, who had remained trapped inside the Quantum Realm, and with whom Lang became psychically entangled with while he was there. This resulted in Lang being kidnapped by Pym and Hope van Dyne, who had built a Quantum Tunnel machine and intended to use it and Ant-Man to rescue Janet. These plans went awry when Ant-Man and Wasp were confronted by both Ghost and Sonny Burch, who wanted to steal the Quantum Tunnel machine for their own reasons. Ant-Man, Wasp, and Pym eventually succeeded in rescuing Janet from the Quantum Realm, and Ant-Man was able to return home to finish his house arrest, narrowly avoiding an extended prison sentence.
However, during a trip to the Quantum Realm to gather quantum particles for Ghost, Ant-Man became trapped as Pym's entire family was turned to dust by Thanos. Ant-Man was unable to escape until 2023, where he regrouped with the Avengers and suggested that they use the Quantum Realm as a means of time travel to the past. Ant-Man then officially joined the Avengers and participated in the Time Heist, where they successfully managed to acquire the six Infinity Stones from alternate pasts and used the Stones to resurrect the victims of Thanos' Snap. However, an alternate Thanos had managed to follow the Avengers through time, and Ant-Man fought in the resulting Battle of Earth. Thanos and his army were eventually destroyed, after which Lang celebrated the victory with van Dyne and Cassie, and attended Tony Stark's funeral.
Now famous to the public, Lang returned to the Quantum Realm when he and the rest of his family were accidentally pulled through a portal created by Cassie. Separated from the rest of the group, Lang and Cassie encountered the Freedom Fighters, and accidentally led M.O.D.O.K., who revealed himself to be Cross, to their location. M.O.D.O.K captured the pair and brought them back to Axia to face Kang the Conqueror. Kang threatened to kill Cassie if Lang did not retrieve the Multiversal Engine Core, so Lang was forced to comply. However, Kang was ultimately killed once the group inspired a full-on revolution by the people living under Kang's tyranny, but not without massive casualties, including Cross. Lang returned to his daily life, but started to become increasingly paranoid about a warning given to him by Kang about a coming threat that only he could stop, leading Lang to question if killing him was the right decision.",scott lang - ant man
"""My armor, it was never a distraction or a hobby, it was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. But one thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man.""
―Tony Stark
Anthony Edward ""Tony"" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Following his fight against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man.
Fresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark found himself dying due to his own Arc Reactor poisoning his body, all while he was challenged by Ivan Vanko who attempted to destroy his legacy. After the Stark Expo incident, Stark reluctantly agreed to serve as a consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D. where he used his position to upgrade their technology while he began a relationship with Pepper Potts. With the world yet again being threatened, Stark joined the Avengers and helped defeat the Chitauri and Loki. Due to the battle, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, leading him to create the Iron Legion to safeguard the world and help him retire.
The 2012 ""Mandarin"" terrorist attacks forced Stark to come out of retirement to protect his country, inadvertently putting his loved ones at risk and leaving him defenseless when his home was destroyed. Stark continued his mission, finding Aldrich Killian as the mastermind of the attacks. Eventually, Stark defeated Killian, and was prompted to destroy all of his armors with the Clean Slate Protocol after almost losing Potts. However, when the Avengers were officially demobilized due to the War on HYDRA, Stark built more armors and resumed his role as Iron Man, aiding them in the capture of Baron Strucker and acquiring Loki's Scepter.
Once the threat of HYDRA had been ended, at last, Stark, influenced by Scarlet Witch's visions, built Ultron with the help of Bruce Banner as a new peacekeeping A.I. to protect the world and allow the Avengers to retire. However, Ultron believed that humanity threatened the world and thus, according to his program, decided to extinguish humanity. Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was defeated, however, not without massive civilian cost and many lives being lost during which Sokovia was elevated into the sky.
After the Ultron Offensive, Stark retired from active duty, still haunted by his role in the chaos the A.I. created. The guilt of creating Ultron and causing so much destruction and loss of life eventually convinced Stark to support the Sokovia Accords. Stark was forced to lead a manhunt for his ally Captain America when the latter began protecting the fugitive Winter Soldier, igniting the Avengers Civil War. The result left the Avengers in complete disarray, especially after Stark learned of the Winter Soldier's role in his parents' deaths. Afterwards, Stark returned to New York to mentor and guide Spider-Man into becoming a better hero than he ever was, also becoming engaged with Potts in the process.
In 2018, when Thanos and the Black Order invaded Earth in their conquest to acquire the six Infinity Stones, Stark, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man convened to battle Thanos on Titan with the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy. When Stark was held at Thanos' mercy, Doctor Strange surrendered the Time Stone for Stark's life. After the Snap, Stark and Nebula remained the sole survivors on Titan. Stark and Nebula used the Benatar to escape Titan, but were stranded in space as the ship was damaged. They were rescued by Captain Marvel, who brought them back to Earth.
In the five years after the Snap, Stark chose to retire from being Iron Man, marrying Potts and having a daughter, Morgan. When Stark devised a method to safely travel through time and space, he rejoined the Avengers in their mission to acquire the six Infinity Stones from the past in order to resurrect those killed by the Snap, and traveled back in time to retrieve the Scepter and regain the Tesseract. During the Battle of Earth, Stark sacrificed himself to eliminate an alternate version of Thanos and his army, who traveled through time to collect their Infinity Stones, saving the universe from decimation and leaving behind a legacy as one of Earth's most revered superheroes.",tony stark - iron man
"""The principle S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded upon was pure.""
""Protection.""
""Protection. One word. Sometimes, to protect one man against himself. Other times, to protect the planet against an alien invasion from another universe. It's a broad job description.""
―Nick Fury and Melinda May
The Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division, better known by its acronym S.H.I.E.L.D., is an American extra-governmental counter-terrorism and intelligence agency tasked with maintaining both national and global security.
Founded in the wake of the Allied victory over the Axis powers and HYDRA in World War II, S.H.I.E.L.D. was organized to protect the United States from all possible threats. With its advanced weapons and extraordinary agents, S.H.I.E.L.D. was maybe the greatest military power on Earth. Following his encounter with Captain Marvel, S.H.I.E.L.D. was run by Nick Fury and the World Security Council in the modern age; S.H.I.E.L.D. had to deal with the significant rise in enhanced individuals, dangerous advanced technology, and alien contact. But all the problems S.H.I.E.L.D. had to solve eventually led to the formation of the Avengers, a response team that was recruited to save the world during the alien invasion of Earth in 2012. The agency became publicly known after the Battle of New York, partially because of the Rising Tide website.
In 2014, through the actions of Black Widow and Nick Fury, the world became aware of the fact that S.H.I.E.L.D. was infiltrated and largely controlled by HYDRA. After the battle in which S.H.I.E.L.D.'s primary headquarters, the Triskelion, was heavily damaged, all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s classified files were dumped on the Internet, and the agency was disavowed by the United States government and labeled a terrorist organization. Many S.H.I.E.L.D. officials were taken into custody and subjected to rigorous questioning. However, despite the massive manhunt on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s agents, a few operatives scattered across the world in most secret bases remained loyal to their oath, saving the most necessary technology for future use. But the team most responsible for the survival of S.H.I.E.L.D. was the team of Agent Phil Coulson, who valiantly led his teammates against the forces of HYDRA led by the traitors John Garrett and Grant Ward, winning the battle in which Garrett's plan ultimately failed. After that battle, Fury appointed Phil Coulson the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and tasked him with rebuilding the agency from scratch, becoming a shadow parapolicial agency.
Now working from the shadows and hunted by almost every army in the world, Coulson used his old team as the core of S.H.I.E.L.D. and recruited mercenaries, former agents, and others to help fill the organization's ranks while simultaneously continuing the fight against HYDRA. At the same time, another faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. arose, this one led by Robert Gonzales, who refused to accept Coulson's authority, believing his faction to be the only ""real S.H.I.E.L.D."" After the Battle for the Kree City, Gonzales' faction revealed its existence, attacking and capturing Coulson's base, the Playground. This ignited an open conflict between the two S.H.I.E.L.D. factions. However, after successfully working together to attack and destroy the Arctic HYDRA Research Facility, Coulson successfully proposed a merger of the two factions which occurred in mid-2015. But the peace did not last long, as the Inhumans, a super-powered humanoid race led by Jiaying, declared war on S.H.I.E.L.D. The fight was short, and S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to prevent any further damage. After the war, Coulson started a new program of recruiting and training Inhumans for a team to deal with various threats.
The Inhuman Outbreak soon followed, and S.H.I.E.L.D. had to stand against the implications it caused. Following the exposure and the abrupt end of HYDRA's infiltration of the ATCU, S.H.I.E.L.D. was semi-legalized as the black ops division of Matthew Ellis' administration, with the ATCU serving as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s public face. With HYDRA suffering a crippling blow, S.H.I.E.L.D. became aware of the dark Inhuman, Hive, and soon had to fight against his Inhuman army, which intended to transform all humanity into Inhumans. As the war with Hive reached its end, Lincoln Campbell sacrificed his life to destroy Hive in a nuclear explosion in space.
In the aftermath of Hive's defeat, S.H.I.E.L.D. was once again legalized following the signing of the Sokovia Accords, but under a new Director, Jeffrey Mace. Daisy Johnson abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. and became a vigilante known as Quake. At the same time, they had to deal with new threats, Eli Morrow, who, with the knowledge of the mysterious book called the Darkhold, managed to gain incredible powers. In order to defeat him, S.H.I.E.L.D. worked together with Johnson and Ghost Rider. After the victory over Morrow, Johnson rejoined the organization. The revelation that Mace was not an Inhuman caused Coulson to return to the possession as the Director de facto. Following Holden Radcliffe's betrayal for the Watchdogs and the replacement of almost every key agent by an LMD by him, Agents Johnson and Jemma Simmons entered the Framework in order to rescue their missing friends. Despite the operation's success, they soon had to deal with Aida, who became an Inhuman seeking to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. With the help of Ghost Rider, they killed her, but it caused the organization's shutdown, as Aida and the Superior managed to frame Johnson for the attempted assassination of Glenn Talbot.
A short time after that, a Chronicom named Enoch sent the team, except Leo Fitz, to the year 2091 to fulfill a prophecy. They found themselves in the Lighthouse bunker, which was populated with the remaining of the human race, following a catastrophic event that caused Earth's destruction. For the team to survive there, they had to blend in among the humans and fight the Kree, who ruled the place under Kasius' orders while also finding a way back to the present. They eventually managed to return, joining with agents rallied by Deathlok and started a race against time to prevent the Destruction of Earth. After fighting against HYDRA led by Hale, the Confederacy, and Glenn Talbot, S.H.I.E.L.D changed the course of history and saved Earth. However, Fitz died in the process. Since Coulson was dying, he and Melinda May left S.H.I.E.L.D. to spend time together until his death, and Mackenzie took over the mantle of Director. The remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agents then took off on a mission to find the present version of Fitz, who was frozen in suspended animation in deep space.
One year later, Mackenzie managed to rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D., recruiting more agents. After searching for signals of paranormal activities, S.H.I.E.L.D. found themselves in conflict with a mysterious group, led by someone who looked exactly like Coulson named Sarge. Meanwhile, Simmons and Johnson were still on their deep-space search for Fitz, finding themselves at odds with the Chronicoms, who also wanted to find Fitz to save their planet. After rescuing Deke Shaw from Sarge's Squad, May was captured by them, where she learned about Sarge's mission to eliminate the Shrike and their creator. May was able to get free and brought Sarge to the Lighthouse. Back in space, Simmons reunited with Fitz while the rest of the team returned to Earth. Fitz and Simmons were brought back home with the help of Izel, who turned out to be who Sarge was hunting. After an uneasy alliance with Sarge, S.H.I.E.L.D. fought against Izel, while the Lighthouse fell under attack by the Chronicoms. They were able to defeat Izel and Sarge, but they lost the Lighthouse. When the Chronicoms traveled back in time to attack S.H.I.E.L.D.'s history, S.H.I.E.L.D. worked with Enoch to stop this threat, building an advanced Life-Model Decoy of Phil Coulson to help them.
In the War Against the Chronicoms, S.H.I.E.L.D. began their time-travel quest to stop the Chronicoms from killing Wilfred Malick, a HYDRA operative from the 1930s who delivered an ingredient of the Super Soldier Serum to the Red Skull. They then traveled to 1955, where they met Agent Daniel Sousa while stopping Sibyl and the Chronicoms from activating Helius ― and in turn ― saving Sousa from HYDRA. Later in the 1970s, S.H.I.E.L.D. stopped the alternate S.H.I.E.L.D. from activating Project Insight and lost the Coulson LMD in the process of destroying the main Chronicom time ship underneath the Lighthouse. After regrouping in the 1980s, the Inhuman sanctuary Afterlife was attacked by Nathaniel Malick, who allied himself with the destructive Inhuman Kora to conquer Afterlife and cause anarchy. The S.H.I.E.L.D. team were then trapped in a time storm, forcing Daisy Johnson and the Coulson LMD to relive time-loops while trying to stop it before Enoch gave up his life which allowed the team to repair the Time Drive and escape the storm. Once they escaped, S.H.I.E.L.D. proceeded to rescue the trapped Inhumans at Afterlife from Nathaniel Malick's Crew. Malick, on the other hand, killed Jiaying and kidnapped Simmons to use her to find Fitz. After witnessing the Destruction of S.H.I.E.L.D. Facilities, S.H.I.E.L.D. set out to defeat the Chronicoms in a final battle that resulted in S.H.I.E.L.D. returning to the main timeline and defeating the Chronicoms. Deke Shaw stayed behind in the alternate 1983 to help the team return, thus allowing Alphonso Mackenzie to continue S.H.I.E.L.D. as the Director in the main timeline, and Shaw became the Director in the alternate timeline.
Following the Blip, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. was present during the Battle of Earth and published a book about the battle. Months later, S.H.I.E.L.D. also lent its support to Nick Fury during the Elemental attacks in Europe by creating a stealth suit for Spider-Man, allowing him to operate as Night Monkey.",s.h.i.e.l.d - avengers
"Carol Susan Jane Danvers is a former United States Air Force pilot who, upon being exposed to the energy of the Tesseract via the destruction of the Light-Speed Engine, obtained cosmic powers. She gained further powers when she was made into a Kree-human hybrid via a blood transfusion from Yon-Rogg, and had all of her old memories removed, turning her into the Kree's weapon and a member of Starforce. Now operating as Vers, she was captured by Skrulls during the Kree-Skrull War, resulting in her returning to Earth and beginning to recall her past, with help from Nick Fury and Maria Rambeau. Vers subsequently discovered that Yon-Rogg and the Kree Empire had been manipulating her for years, learning from Talos that the Skrulls were merely seeking to find a new home. With this information, Danvers, rejecting her Vers persona, unlocked her true powers and defeated the Kree invasion onto Earth that was being led by Ronan the Accuser, before setting off out to the far reaches of the galaxy to finish what her late mentor Mar-Vell had previously started, honoring her by becoming known as Captain Marvel.
Spending twenty-three years journeying through the universe, Captain Marvel learned of the Snap through the distress call sent out by Fury and had joined the Avengers in an attempt to confront Thanos and reverse the damage done, managing to also rescue Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space along the way. However, despite their first attempt at finding the Infinity Stones failing, Captain Marvel returned to Earth in 2023 when the Avengers had just succeeded with their second attempt to resurrect the victims of the Snap and assisted them during their fight against an alternate Thanos and his army. The combined efforts of Captain Marvel and her allies triumphed over Thanos and his forces, though Iron Man sacrificed his life, with Danvers attending his funeral before leaving Earth.

―Thanos
Thanos was a genocidal warlord from Titan, whose objective was to bring stability to the universe by wiping out half of all life at every level, as he believed its massive population would inevitably use up the universe's entire supply of resources and perish. To complete this goal, Thanos set about hunting down all the Infinity Stones, being confident that the combined force of the Stones would grant him sufficient power. Thanos forged alliances with Loki and Ronan the Accuser in order to track down some of the Stones. However, both alliances cost Thanos much of his resources, including the Mind Stone and the loyalty of his daughters, Gamora and Nebula. Fed up with all his subordinates' ongoing failures, Thanos made the decision to seek and procure the Stones himself, and he began by forcing Eitri to create the Infinity Gauntlet for him so that he would be able to wield the power of the Stones safely.
Thanos then engaged in a ferocious crusade in order to obtain the Infinity Stones. During his mission, both Thanos and his Black Order invaded multiple planets and slaughtered thousands to gain the stones, including Loki and the Asgardians. This quest even forced Thanos to sacrifice his beloved Gamora, in order to take the Soul Stone. Thanos soon found himself challenged by the alliances of the entire universe's greatest heroes, which included the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. However, despite facing off against the powerfully combined opposition and the wrath of Thor, Thanos still ultimately triumphed as he completed the Infinity Gauntlet, using it to finally complete his goal through the Snap, which resulted in half of all life in the universe being wiped out with a mere snap of his fingers. Following his Snap, Thanos had then ensured this could never be undone by destroying all of the Infinity Stones, resulting in the Avengers tracking him down on Planet 0259-S, where Thor executed him with Stormbreaker.",thanos - avengers
"""The Avengers. That's what we call ourselves. We're sort of like a team. 'Earth's Mightiest Heroes'-type thing.""
―Tony Stark to Loki
The Avengers were a team of extraordinary individuals, with either superpowers or other special characteristics. Though primarily affiliated with the interests of the United States of America, the group's purpose was to protect global stability from inner or extraterrestrial threats. The Avengers were first assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a result of the Avengers Initiative, when Loki invaded Earth with his Chitauri army. The team, consisting of Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye defeated Loki and went their separate ways for a while.
After S.H.I.E.L.D. became a defunct agency due to the HYDRA infiltration, the team was no longer an American governmental division, therefore becoming an independent and private organization. Stark Industries remodeled Stark Tower into Avengers Tower and the team joined in the fight against HYDRA. After their victory, Stark built Ultron, hoping that the A.I. would be able to defend the world from any threats necessary in place of the Avengers. The plan backfired and Ultron started a war against humanity, forcing the Avengers to fight him. When Ultron was defeated, Hulk, Barton, Thor and Stark left the team, so Wanda Maximoff, Vision, War Machine and Falcon were recruited, and they were relocated to the Avengers Compound.
Under Captain America's leadership, the team completed several operations around the world with success, until the amount of collateral damage during their conflicts caused the United Nations to pass the Sokovia Accords in an attempt to regulate their actions, turning the team from a private organization to one which was under the control of a governmental body. The differences in opinions created a rift within the team which split the Avengers into two factions, one led by Iron Man and the other by Captain America. After Captain America was able to stop Helmut Zemo, the instigator of their fight, the team was divided; Iron Man, Vision and War Machine remained official members, while a small group consisting of Captain America, Black Widow, and Falcon continued to operate in the shadows. Stark would try to boost the Avengers' membership by inviting Spider-Man to join, but the young hero turned down the offer to remain closer to the people he had sworn to protect.
Two years after the Accords were ratified, Thanos launched a crusade against the universe in his quest to gather the Infinity Stones. The Avengers were split up into different groups as they fought to combat Thanos before he succeeded, joining forces with the Masters of the Mystic Arts, the Wakandans, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Iron Man and Spider-Man went to Titan alongside Doctor Strange, where they allied with Star-Lord, Nebula, Mantis and Drax to try to stop Thanos, while Captain America, Banner, Black Widow, War Machine, Falcon, Thor, Groot, Rocket Raccoon and Maximoff protected Vision from the Black Order in Wakanda. The team on Wakanda was successful in killing Thanos' minions, but the team on Titan was defeated. Thanos arrived and overpowered the heroes on Wakanda with ease before killing Vision to acquire the Mind Stone, thus completing the Infinity Gauntlet, and eradicating half of the universe's population. Among the victims were Falcon, Maximoff, and Spider-Man; with Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Banner, Black Widow and War Machine being the only Avengers to survive the war. Despite them managing to kill Thanos, the victory was empty, as the Infinity Stones were destroyed, ensuring no chances of undoing the Snap. This resulted in Iron Man, Captain America and Thor retiring from the team. Black Widow then became the team's new leader, commanding War Machine as well as new members Rocket, Nebula, Captain Marvel and Okoye, as they strove to maintain order on Earth and the wider universe.
Five years later, Ant-Man escaped from the Quantum Realm and provided the Avengers with a chance to time travel, so the Avengers assembled once more. With Ant-Man officially joining the roster, the Avengers initiated a Time Heist, where they traveled to alternate timelines and collected the six Infinity Stones. Returning to their timeline with the Stones, at the cost of Black Widow's life, Banner donned the Nano Gauntlet and was able to resurrect those who died in the Snap. However, an alternate timeline Thanos and his army had followed them, sparking the immense Battle of Earth, where Iron Man gave his life to defeat Thanos and his army. With the battle won and over, and the remaining members going their separate ways, the Avengers effectively disbanded.",avengers

―Thor to Mighty Thor
Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, the former king of both Asgard and New Asgard, a founding member of the Avengers, and a former member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited an ancient war between Asgard and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power and hammer Mjølnir, he was banished to Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth, Thor found love with Jane Foster, and learned humility by saving his new friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act of sacrifice, Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which he then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.
Upon being welcomed back to Asgard as a hero, Thor was forced to return to Earth in order to retrieve Loki after he had begun his attempt at world domination with the Tesseract. Thor joined the Avengers under the guidance of S.H.I.E.L.D. and stood with them to stop Loki's schemes, eventually following the newly formed team as they battled against Loki's Chitauri army during the Battle of New York. After Loki's defeat, Thor captured and returned him to Asgard to await justice for his crimes.
Thor helped the Asgardian armies restore peace across all of the Nine Realms during the War of the Nine Realms. However, the peace was disrupted by Malekith and the Dark Elves, who wanted to use the Aether to plunge the Nine Realms into eternal darkness. When Foster absorbed the Aether, Thor rallied to protect her on Asgard, leading to an attack by Malekith which resulted in Frigga's death. When the Aether was eventually removed from Foster, Thor helped defeat Malekith and his forces before they could unleash the Aether during the Convergence. Thor renounced his claim to the throne and left Asgard for Earth so he could stay with Foster. During their time together, Thor enchanted Mjølnir to protect Foster.
During his stay on Earth, Thor helped the Avengers to locate Loki's Scepter during the fight against HYDRA. Following HYDRA's defeat and the capture of Baron Strucker, the team had to stop the newly created Ultron, a rogue A.I. created by Tony Stark which conspired to bring about human extinction. Once Ultron had been defeated, Thor went back to Asgard to investigate the visions he saw when being manipulated by Wanda Maximoff of the Infinity Stones. In his investigations, Thor also discovered that Loki was still alive and had usurped Odin's royal throne during Thor's absence.
To aid in both pursuing his brother and finding his father to return peace to Asgard, Thor sought help from Doctor Strange, who led him to Odin moments before his passing to Valhalla. Shortly afterwards, Thor met Hela, the Goddess of Death and his half-sister. In the wake of his first encounter with Hela, Mjølnir was destroyed and he was stranded in Sakaar, where he was forced to compete in the Contest of Champions. After a reunion and subsequent fight with Hulk, the pair allied with the rogue Valkyrie in order to save Asgard and escape Sakaar. After battling with Hela and losing an eye to her, Thor then had Loki unleash Ragnarök and destroy Asgard, killing Hela in the process, although he escaped with the remaining Asgardians. Declaring that Asgard was all its people and not a place, Thor accepted his newfound position as king and decided to relocate the Asgardians on Earth.
As they were en route to Earth, their ship was attacked by Thanos and the Black Order, who took the the Tesseract and murdered his brother, before leaving Thor for dead. He was rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy and had teamed up with Rocket Raccoon and Groot to travel to Nidavellir. With the help of Eitri, Thor crafted Stormbreaker and aided the nation of Wakanda and the Avengers in confronting Thanos and his forces. However, Thor squandered his chance to kill Thanos with his new weapon and Thanos activated the completed Infinity Gauntlet and erased half the universe's population from existence. After the Avengers were joined by Captain Marvel, the team traveled to the Garden, where Thor and the Avengers ambushed Thanos, discovering that the Titan destroyed the Stones, ensuring that a reversal of his actions was now impossible. Enraged, Thor beheaded Thanos using Stormbreaker and left the planet.
Following Thanos' death, Thor left the Avengers and relocated to Tønsberg, Norway, where he and the surviving Asgardians resettled, establishing New Asgard. Five years later, Hulk and Rocket convinced the now-overweight and depressed Thor to rejoin the team after discovering how to travel through time. Thor joined the Avengers on their Time Heist and the ensuing battle against an alternate Thanos alongside Captain America and Iron Man, ending in Stark sacrificing his life to destroy Thanos' forces. After attending Stark's funeral, Thor decided to join the Guardians of the Galaxy, proclaiming Valkyrie to succeed him as king of the Asgardians.
For months, Thor journeyed with the Guardians, but his time with them was brought to an end in 2024 due to Gorr's vow against the gods. During a battle against Gorr, Thor would be joined by his former flame, Jane Foster, who to Thor's surprise now wielded Mjølnir. Thor, joined by Korg, Valkyrie and Foster went on a mission to warn the other gods and get an army to fight Gorr, Thor and his team travel to Omnipotence City to warn Zeus. The disagreement of the Olympians led to confrontation, in which then Thor heavily injured Zeus. Eventually, Thor alongside Foster managed to defeat Gorr but at the cost of her life. After Gorr died, Thor adopted his daughter and trained her, with the duo becoming known as Love and Thunder, who set off upon adventures as protectors of other aliens across the universe.",thor - avengers

""You'd think that saving the world would get you there, but it doesn't.""

Doctor Stephen Vincent Strange, M.D., Ph.D. is a Master of the Mystic Arts. Originally a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon, Strange got into a car accident which resulted in his hands becoming crippled. Once Western medicine failed him, Strange embarked on a journey to Kamar-Taj, where he was trained by the Ancient One in the ways of Magic and the Multiverse. Although he focused on healing his hands, Strange was drawn into a conflict with Kaecilius and the Zealots, who were working for Dormammu and had sought to merge Earth with the Dark Dimension. Following the demise of the Ancient One and the defeat of Kaecilius, Strange then became the new protector of the Sanctum Sanctorum, seeking to defend the Earth from other inter-dimensional threats.
From his new position, Strange aided Thor in locating Odin, before he learned of Thanos' attempts to gain all of the Infinity Stones and cause a universal genocide. Since Strange was the protector of the Time Stone, he was attacked and captured by Thanos' Black Order, only for him to then be rescued by Iron Man and Spider-Man. Joining forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Strange battled against Thanos. However, as Strange had seen into the future and knew his only path to victory, he willingly handed over the Time Stone, allowing Thanos to wipe out half of life, including Strange. However, Strange and all the rest of Thanos' victims had been resurrected five years later by the Avengers and battled against an alternate Thanos, ending in the Mad Titan's defeat.
Strange offered his aid to Spider-Man, whose identity of Peter Parker was unmasked by Mysterio, as he asked Strange to make the world forget this. However, due to Parker's interference, the spell soon went wrong, and Strange inadvertently unleashed enemies of Spider-Men from across the Multiverse. Capturing these enemies, Strange tried to use the Macchina di Kadavus to send them to their universes to meet their inevitable fates, which Spider-Man had refused to allow, hoping to give these people a chance at redemption. Having been trapped in the Mirror Dimension, Strange then returned and fought to contain the Multiversal rift. With no other choice, Strange cast a spell to return the visitors back to their universes and close the rifts, but also at the cost of making everyone, including himself, forget Parker's existence.
Being heralded of new interdimensional threats, Strange came across America Chavez. While investigating these threats, Strange learned that Wanda Maximoff, who fell under the influence of the Darkhold, was responsible. As Kamar-Taj fell under attack by her, Chavez sent Strange spiraling through the multiverse, where they were eventually arrested by the Illuminati. With the help of a alternate Christine Palmer, Strange and Chavez escape, only for Maximoff abduct Chavez, banishing Strange and Palmer to an incursion inflicted universe. Confronting that reality's Doctor Strange, Strange claimed the Darkhold, utilizing dreamwalking in order to rescue Chavez. Helping her gain full control of her powers, the two swayed Maximoff from the Darkhold's influence, before her apparent self-sacrifice to destroy all copies of the Darkhold throughout the Multiverse. In the aftermath, Strange and Wong took Chavez, who decided to stay in their universe, under their care and teach her in the Mystic Arts. Sometime later, Strange was confronted by Clea, a sorceress who enlisted his help in fixing a new incursion.",docter strange

Peter Benjamin Parker is a former Midtown School of Science and Technology student who gained superhuman abilities and fought crime across New York City as the superhero Spider-Man. While he juggled his hero duties with the demands of his high-school life, he was recruited by Tony Stark to join the Avengers Civil War, putting Spider-Man into a brief conflict with Captain America. Parker was given a new suit as well as new Stark technology in exchange for his help and was allowed to keep them when he returned home to continue his own hero work.
While he continued to try and prove himself as a worthy hero in the eyes of Iron Man so he could join the Avengers, Parker began investigating the illicit criminal activities of Vulture, who was attempting to sell his Chitauri based weapons onto the black market, with only the assistance of his best friend Ned Leeds, while also trying to win his academic decathlon finals. Eventually, Parker gained the affections of classmate Liz Allan, but learned her father, Adrian Toomes, was Vulture. Spider-Man thwarted Vulture's robbery of a Stark Industries cargo plane, to which Stark showed his respect by offering Parker an official place with the Avengers. Parker turned this down in order to continue being a small-time hero in New York, despite his Aunt May discovering his secret identity.
Parker was pulled back into the Avengers' conflict when the Black Order had invaded Earth, joining Stark as a stowaway to rescue Doctor Strange from space. Given a new Iron Spider armor, Parker, Stark and Strange joined forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy, joining their attempts to prevent Thanos from collecting the six Infinity Stones. But the heroes failed to defeat Thanos during the Battle of Titan; resulting in half of life being wiped out; including Parker. Five years later, Spider-Man was resurrected in the Blip, and rejoined the fight against Thanos, ultimately watching Stark sacrifice his life to defeat the Mad Titan.
The bereaved and traumatized Parker decided to take some time off his hero duties, seeking refuge on his school trip to Europe. However, despite wanting to focus his attention on winning the attention of Michelle Jones, Parker witnessed Hydro-Man's attack in Venice and was recruited by ""Nick Fury"" to work with Mysterio to defeat the Elementals. Dubbed Night Monkey after defeating Molten Man in Prague, Parker bequeathed Stark's glasses to Mysterio, only to discover that Mysterio manipulated him in doing so to gain access to Stark's weaponized drones to stage more threats. Recruiting Happy Hogan's help, Spider-Man traveled to London and defeated Mysterio, who died of a misfired gunshot on the Tower Bridge.
Upon Parker's return to New York, doctored footage was sent to The Daily Bugle incriminating him as the mastermind of the drone attacks, as well as the murderer of Mysterio, while exposing his true identity to the world. While he was eventually cleared of all charges with Matt Murdock's help, the resulting controversy upended his and his friends' futures, leading Parker to enlist Doctor Strange to cast a memory-altering spell, wishing to make the identity of Spider-Man a secret once more. However, Parker's repeated amendments mid-casting ruined the spell, resulting in a multiversal rift that unleashed foes of Spider-Man from alternate universes. Although intending to cure them before sending them back to avert their ill-fated deaths in their native universes, Green Goblin convinced the villains to betray Parker, ultimately resulting in his aunt's death. Parker then met two alternate versions of himself who helped him overcome his grief and cure their enemies in a battle on the Statue of Liberty. Faced with an impossible choice, Parker had Strange cast another spell to make their universe oblivious to his existence in order to protect the Multiverse from collapsing, erasing himself from his friends and allies memories in his universe. Starting anew and believing himself to be dangerous to those around him, Parker decided to isolate himself from everyone, including his friends and allies, in order to keep them safe and resumed his duties undisturbed as an independent Spider-Man.",peter parker - spider man
"The Guardians of the Galaxy are a team of intergalactic mercenaries who primarily defend the Andromeda galaxy. The team was founded in 2014 when Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket Raccoon, Groot and Drax the Destroyer assembled to save Xandar from being decimated by Ronan the Accuser. Recognized by the Nova Empire, the Guardians were hired shortly after by the Sovereign's leader Ayesha to defeat an Abilisk, but became their enemies when Rocket stole from them. They gained three new members in Mantis, Nebula and Yondu Udonta when they banded together to defeat Ego, which resulted in Udonta's death. Nebula then left the team as the remaining Guardians resumed their adventures.
Four years later, the Guardians joined forces with the Avengers to stop Thanos from collecting the Infinity Stones. However, Gamora was taken by Thanos who later sacrificed her for the Soul Stone. Despite their best efforts to stop him, they were defeated on Titan and Wakanda as Thanos completed the Infinity Gauntlet, using it to murder half the universe's population. The Guardians of the Galaxy then ceased to exist as most of its members were now dead, with the only survivors, Rocket and Nebula, officially joining the Avengers.
The Guardians of the Galaxy were reassembled in 2023 when most of their members, with the sole exception of Gamora, were resurrected by the Avengers. They participated in the battle against another Thanos alongside an alternate Gamora, both of whom had come from another timeline. Following their victory, the Guardians departed Earth with Thor, who joined the group, with Kraglin Obfonteri joining them shortly after.
As they returned to defend the cosmos, the Guardians undertook several missions, culminating in the Battle of Indigarr. After the battle, the team learned of the rampage of Gorr the God Butcher, prompting Thor to leave the group. The Guardians then purchased Knowhere from the Collector, where they found Cosmo, who became their new member. They worked to transform Knowhere into their official headquarters and celebrated Christmas with Kevin Bacon, whom they had kidnapped.
In 2026, the Guardians were attacked on Knowhere by Adam Warlock, which resulted in Rocket being severely wounded. In order to save his life, the Guardians allied with the Ravagers, which included the alternate Gamora, to infiltrate OrgoCorp. Joined by Gamora, the Guardians of the Galaxy traveled to Counter-Earth to revive Rocket, after which they assembled to defeat High Evolutionary and liberate his test subjects, including a young girl named Phyla. Returning back to Knowhere, Gamora, Star-Lord, Mantis, Drax and Nebula elected to leave the team to live individual lives. Rocket was then appointed as the new leader and led a new iteration of the team comprised of himself, Groot, Obfonteri and Cosmo along with new members Blurp, Phyla and Adam Warlock.",the guardians of the galaxy
